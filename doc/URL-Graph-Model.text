1. The Layered Graph of URLs
The URLs of a Web site are modeled by an acycled directed graph (i.e., layered graph)

- A url is tokenized by HTTP special chars specified by HTTP protocol (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html)
						"(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@"
                      	| "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <">
                      	| "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="
                   		| "{" | "}" | SP | HT
- Each token is represented by a node in the layered graph
- The sequence of tokens of a URL consists of a path in the order of appearance
- The sequence of nodes path has an extra head node that is the request method of this URL (e.g., GET or POST)
- Each node in the graph has the following attributes:
	label
	layer_id
	count
	parents
	children

2. The MetaModel
Once the layered graph is constructed, the model needs categerize the nodes into  the following two groups:
-Nodes with a large number of appearances are constants
-Nodes with a small number of appearances are variables

After the categorization, the graph will has three types of nodes:
-method nodes
-constant nodes
-metanode: variable nodes under one constant node are represented by one node, metanode
