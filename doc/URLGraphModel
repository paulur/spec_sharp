1. The Layered Graph of URLs
The URLs of a Web site are modeled by an acycled directed graph (i.e., layered graph)

- A url is tokenized by HTTP special chars specified by HTTP protocol (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html)
						"(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@"
                      	| "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <">
                      	| "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="
                   		| "{" | "}" | SP | HT
- Each token is represented by a node in the layered graph
- The sequence of tokens of a URL consists of a path in the order of appearance
